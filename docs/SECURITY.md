# Security Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a security analysis of the QuantaWeave implementation.

## Scope and Repository Notes

- The repository includes an LWE-based encryption library and a code-based HQC KEM implementation in `quantaweave/hqc/`.
- The `encapsulation_decapsulation.py` demo uses RSA-OAEP for key wrapping, which is **not** post-quantum secure, and requires the `cryptography` package.
- The `key_generation.py` file is a disabled RSA keygen example (wrapped in a docstring).
- `kyber_dilithium_hqc.py` contains placeholders only and does not implement those schemes.
- `results_v2.md` is a baseline template with sample data, not verified benchmarks.
- Falcon signatures are provided via a C++ binding and require GMP at build/runtime.

## Threat Model

### Classical Attackers
- **Computational Power**: Limited to polynomial-time classical algorithms
- **Attack Vector**: Attempting to recover the secret key or plaintext from public information

### Quantum Attackers
- **Computational Power**: Access to large-scale quantum computers
- **Attack Vector**: Using quantum algorithms (e.g., Shor's, Grover's) to break cryptography

## Security Foundations

### Learning With Errors (LWE) Problem

The security of our algorithm is based on the hardness of the LWE problem:

**Problem**: Given pairs (aᵢ, bᵢ = ⟨aᵢ, s⟩ + eᵢ mod q), recover the secret vector s.

**Properties**:
- Proven to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems (e.g., GapSVP)
- Quantum-resistant (no known efficient quantum algorithms)
- Well-studied in cryptographic research

## Security Levels

### LEVEL1 (128-bit Security)
- **Parameters**: n=256, q=3329
- **Classical Security**: ~2¹²⁸ operations
- **Quantum Security**: ~2⁶⁴ quantum operations (still very secure)
- **Use Case**: General-purpose encryption

### LEVEL3 (192-bit Security)
- **Parameters**: n=512, q=7681
- **Classical Security**: ~2¹⁹² operations
- **Quantum Security**: ~2⁹⁶ quantum operations
- **Use Case**: High-security applications

### LEVEL5 (256-bit Security)
- **Parameters**: n=1024, q=12289
- **Classical Security**: ~2²⁵⁶ operations
- **Quantum Security**: ~2¹²⁸ quantum operations
- **Use Case**: Maximum security for long-term protection

## Known Attacks and Countermeasures

### 1. Lattice Reduction Attacks

**Attack**: Use BKZ or LLL algorithms to find short vectors in the lattice.

**Countermeasure**: 
- Parameters chosen such that lattice dimension is large enough
- Modulus q chosen to prevent reduction attacks
- Current parameters provide security margins

### 2. Key Recovery Attacks

**Attack**: Try to recover the secret key from the public key.

**Countermeasure**:
- Error distribution (centered binomial) ensures sufficient noise
- LWE hardness prevents key recovery
- Secret key coefficients are small and hard to distinguish

### 3. Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCA)

**Status**: Current implementation is CPA-secure (Chosen Plaintext Attack)

**Note**: For CCA security, additional transformations are needed:
- Fujisaki-Okamoto transform
- Error correction codes
- Re-encryption check

### 4. Side-Channel Attacks

**Potential Vulnerabilities**:
- Timing attacks (variable-time operations)
- Power analysis
- Cache timing

**Mitigations Needed** (not implemented in this version):
- Constant-time implementations
- Masking techniques
- Randomized computation

### 5. Grover's Algorithm

**Attack**: Quantum search algorithm can speed up brute force by √n.

**Countermeasure**:
- Security levels account for Grover's speedup
- Parameters chosen to maintain target security post-quantum

### 6. HQC Attack Surface Notes

**Scope**: Applies to the HQC KEM implementation in `quantaweave/hqc/`.

**Key points**:
- **KEM-only**: HQC provides shared-secret encapsulation, not direct message encryption.
- **Decoding failure rate (DFR)**: HQC has a non-zero DFR; callers must treat decapsulation failures as potential side-channel signals and avoid branching on failure in sensitive contexts.
- **Side-channel exposure**: The RS/RM decoding steps and vector operations are not constant-time in Python.
- **Key/ciphertext sizes**: HQC keys and ciphertexts are large; applications must account for bandwidth and storage overhead.

### 7. Falcon Signature Notes

**Scope**: Applies to the Falcon signature binding.

**Key points**:
- **C++ dependency**: Falcon uses a C++20 implementation with GMP; ensure your build chain is hardened and patched.
- **Side-channel exposure**: No constant-time guarantees are provided by the binding layer.
- **Input validation**: Enforce key and signature length checks before use.

## Implementation Security

### Strengths

1. **Cryptographically Secure Randomness**
   - Uses Python's `secrets` module
   - Cryptographically strong random number generation

2. **Parameter Selection**
   - Based on conservative estimates
   - Follows NIST PQC recommendations

3. **Error Distribution**
   - Centered binomial distribution
   - Appropriate error parameters (eta)

### Limitations

1. **Not Constant-Time**
   - Operations may leak timing information
   - Vulnerable to timing side-channels

2. **No CCA Security**
   - Only CPA-secure (Chosen Plaintext)
   - Additional transformations needed for CCA

3. **Python Implementation**
   - Slower than C/assembly implementations
   - More vulnerable to side-channels

4. **No Compression Optimization**
   - Basic compression used
   - Could be optimized further

## Recommendations for Production Use

### Production Hardening Checklist

- Enforce constant-time operations for sensitive code paths.
- Avoid branching on HQC decapsulation failures (DFR signals).
- Use cryptographically secure randomness and seed management.

## Conclusion
