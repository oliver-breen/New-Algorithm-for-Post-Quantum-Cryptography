# Oliver Breen

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m passionate about cryptography, security, and building robust open-source tools for the post-quantum era.

## 🚀 Latest Projects

### [Quantaweave](https://github.com/oliver-breen/New-Algorithm-for-Post-Quantum-Cryptography)
A modular, research-driven post-quantum cryptography suite supporting Kyber, Dilithium, HQC, hybrid schemes, and more. Includes:
- Unified Python interface for KEMs and signatures
- C/C++ integration with automated DLL builds
- Extensive test suite and benchmarks
- [Quantaweave GUI](https://github.com/oliver-breen/New-Algorithm-for-Post-Quantum-Cryptography/tree/main/gui): User-friendly interface for cryptographic operations

### Other Notable Projects
- **Hybrid PQ Crypto Examples**: Practical hybridization and threshold signature demos
- **Falcon & HQC Integrations**: Standalone and combined cryptosystem implementations
- **Automated CI/CD Workflows**: Linting, static analysis, and cross-platform builds

## 📢 Upcoming Releases
- **Quantaweave 2.0 Alpha**: Major refactor, improved resource management, new build system, and expanded cryptographic support
- **Quantaweave GUI 2.0 Alpha**: Enhanced UX, more algorithms, and better error handling

## 🛠️ Technologies
